# API

This app offers API for a few cases. It is based on Django Rest Framework and uses token authentication.

## Authentication

All GET requests are public. For other requests, you need
to authenticate via token in the header `Authorization=Token <token>`.

For authentication, you need a user with a token. You can create him
in administration and generate token via `python manage.py drf_create_token <username>`.
Already created tokens are available at `/admin/authtoken/tokenproxy`.
